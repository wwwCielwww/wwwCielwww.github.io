Introduce conditional expectation; Can be served as a preliminary for [Martingales](https://wwwcielwww.github.io/posts/2021/05/martingales/). Updating...

**The vector space $\mathcal{L}^1$** (over $\mathbb{R}$). A random variable $X$ is said to be in $\mathcal{L}^1$ if it is integrable, that is, if $\mathbb{E}(\vert X\vert) < \infty$.

**Indicator function** $I_F$ of an event $F$. For an event $F$, we define

$$
I_{F(\omega)}:=
\begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if $\omega\in F$}.\\
    0, & \text{if $\omega\notin F$}.
\end{cases}
$$

Intuitively, $I_F=1$ if $F$ occurs, $0$ if it doesn't. Note that for any $x$, $\{\omega:I_F(\omega)\leq x\}$ can only be one of the three things: $\emptyset, F^c, \Omega$, depending on where $x$ lies in relation to $0$ and $1$. Hence $I_F$ is certainly measurable. We use indicator functions to do counting. The number $Y$ of heads one get in $n$ tosses of a coin is $Y=X_1+X_2+\dots+X_n$, where $X_k$ is the indicator function of the event "Heads on $k$th toss": for the sum counts $1$ for every head, $0$ for every tail.

## **Conditional Expectation** $\mathbb{E}(X\mid A)$ of a random variable $X$ given that event $A$ occurs.

Let $A$ be an event for which $\mathbb{P}(A)>0$, and let $X$ either be in $\mathcal{L}^1$ or be non-negative. We have 

$$
\mathbb{P}(B\mid A):=\frac{\mathbb{P}(A\ \cap \ B)}{\mathbb{P}(A)} = \frac{\mathbb{E}(I_AI_B)}{\mathbb{P}(A)}.
$$

if we interpret $\mathbb{E}(I_B\mid A)$ as $\mathbb{P}(B\mid A)$, this suggests defining

$$
\mathbb{E}(X\mid A):=\frac{\mathbb{E}(I_AX)}{\mathbb{P}(A)} = \mathbb{P} \text{-average of $X$ over $A$.}
$$

To understand the last equality, note that if $\Omega$ is discrete with all its subsets as events, then

$$
\mathbb{E}(X\mid A) = \frac{\sum_{\omega\in A} X(\omega)\mathbb{P}(\omega)}{\mathbb{P}(A)} = \sum_AX(\omega)\mathbb{P}(\{\omega\}\mid A).
$$

For a discrete RV $X$ (in $\mathcal{L}^1$),

$$
\mathbb{E}(X) = \sum_xx\mathbb{P}(X=x)
$$
