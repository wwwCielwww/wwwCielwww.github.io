Introduce conditional expectation; Can be served as a preliminary for [Martingales](https://wwwcielwww.github.io/posts/2021/05/martingales/). Updating...

**Indicator function** $I_F$ of an event $F$. For an event $F$, we define
$$
I_{F(\omega)}:=
\begin{cases}
    1, & \text{if $\omega\in F$}.\\
    0, & \text{if $\omega\notin F$}.
\end{cases}
$$
Intuitively, $I_F=1$ if $F$ occurs, $0$ if it doesn't. Note that for any $x$, $\{\omega:I_F(\omega)\leq x\}$ can only be one of the three things: $\empty, F^c, \Omega$, depending on where $x$ lies in relation to $0$ and $1$. Hence $I_F$ is certainly measurable. We use indicator functions to do counting. The number $Y$ of heads one get in $n$ tosses of a coin is $Y=X_1+X_2+\dots+X_n$, where $X_k$ is the indicator function of the event "Heads on $k$th toss": for the sum counts $1$ for every head, $0$ for every tail.

## **Conditional Expectation** $\mathbb{E}(X\mid A)$ of a random variable $X$ given that event $A$ occurs

Let $A$ be an event
