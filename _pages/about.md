üíï Hello, it's great to have you here! üíï 

## Who Am I?

I'm Ciel, currently doing undergrad at the University of Hong Kong, Faculty of Engineering. I will presumably take Computer Science as my major before the beginning of my sophomore year. Like many CS students and/or to-be, I have a profound passion for mathematics. Probably because it will temporarily get me out of the daily ordeal as a programmerüò≠. It's not like I don't like to code. It's just for now I'm very confused about what I really want from doing so. But still, until I found an answer, I'll keep exploring the new possibilities and share some fun stuff that I encounter along the way. 

If you care to know, my not-so-academic hobbies include travelling, gaming (I'm playing Genshin Impact!!), and ... nothing else. People know me long enough would definitely think me as that kind of unsociable geek locking herself in her room doing somewhat boring stuff all day long. I'd say they are right to some extent, although I do like hanging out on my own to explore the comforting side of this cruel, cruel world. 

You'll know more about my ambitions, intention with this site, etc. in the following sections. ‚ÜòÔ∏è
