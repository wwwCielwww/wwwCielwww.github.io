Dear visitor,

For your better desktop viewing experience, 

- (Chrome) Press `F12` to enter reader mode for less distraction;
- (Chrome) Enable dark mode at [chrome://flags/](chrome://flags/) for eye protection at night;
- (Chrome) Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Del` to clear browsing data;
- Press `Ctrl` + `R` to refresh the current webpage / `Ctrl` + `F5` to clear cache of the webpage;
- Use another browser when MathJax does not render.

Current issues:

- (MathJax) With inline mode,  expressions of the form`\mathxx{x}_x^x` are somehow not rendered correctly, and are messing up the display of the rest of the paragraph. Therefore, as a temporary measure, `\mathxx{}` will not be not used under such circumstances. 
- (Mobile) With a small screen width, the website will automatically adjust its layout. However, the avatar besides my profile may not appear as it should.
- (Mobile) With a small screen width, MathJax expressions in display mode may overflow.

Please feel free to contact me for any matter related to the site. Suggestions for improvements would be greatly appreciated.
